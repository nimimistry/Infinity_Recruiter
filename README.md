# Infinity_Recruiter

**Logo**:<br/>
While designing the logo I took the initials for the company (i and r) and combined both the letters into one (it is in white color) and in the back of the letter I added the symbol of infinity “∞” in orange color. This way I am able to show an infinity symbol as part of the logo.<br/> <br/>

The logo was designed in Photoshop.<br/> <br/>

**Wireframes**:<br/>
Wireframes for the landing page are also included in the project. Wireframe for the projects has been created in Balsamiq Wireframes. <br/>

**Landing Page of INFINITY RECRUITERS**:<br/>
	While designing the landing page of Infinity Recruiters I tried to keep layout consistent with a clear navigation, headline, body and CTA. I had used the contrast color for the search bar and CTA which makes it stand out.<br/>
I tried to keep the page as simple as possible, not adding a lot of navigational links or content. <br/>
The page is divided into<br/>
    **Header** : Header contains the logo and the navigation, this navigation will be the same across the site. The color scheme for the header will also be the                      same across all the pages.<br/> <br/>
    **Body** :  On Landing page the body contains content specific to Landing page.<br/>
      **Team Member Image** :   This image resembles the team member and employee in the company. This resembles the culture in the company.<br/><br/>
      **Search Widget** :       The search widgets help in searching new openings in the company. Users can search based on keywords for the opening.<br/><br/>
      **About Us** :            The about us section contains details about what this company is about. What are the values and what this company stands for. This                                   provides a good overview of the company to any potential employee of the company.<br/><br/>
      **Testimonial** :         I have also added testimonials by existing employees of the company. This would help potential employees to understand the culture                                  in the company.<br/><br/>
      **Footer** :            Footer contains the legal content of the website along with social handles for the company.  Again this would be the same for all the                               pages.<br/><br/>
